About me
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Stanford University. I completed a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and economics at the University of Chicago in 2015.\\
From 2015 to 2017 I worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a research analyst in the Macroeconomic and Monetary Studies division of the Research group, concentrating on nowcasting with macroeconomic data and time series econometrics.\\
I am interested in monetary economics, time series econometrics and search and matching theory.
